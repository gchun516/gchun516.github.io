         <p>Designer Statement
            
            </p>
         <p>
           Biophilic and uniqueness are my design direction. Living with nature gives people feel relaxed and comfortable. Through the biophilic design ideas, I design spaces to let people communicate with nature and their lives in their living spaces. The curvilinear and natural color scheme would enhance the biophilic designs. The uniqueness of an individual comes from nature and its characters. Every aspect of nature has its unique characteristics. Likewise, there are no same tree rings nor fingerprints. I believe that interior designs should represent the uniqueness of users in each space.
             
Each design and artworks represent the uniqueness of the spaces and projects. Both Residential and Commercial design have their characteristics that interior designers need to approach with creative eyes to design space to feel comfortable to all users. Also, good designs make space aesthetic and functional. Through many various art and design project experiences, I could see interior design projects differently. Interior design can be simply a living space. With a sense of artistic view, interior design could create spaces to be living art.
